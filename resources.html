                        <p> This is about how to get your app or platform to grow, starting from zero. It provides you with the tools and vocabulary to better understand the seemingly magical and ellusive buzzword of "network effects."

                        <p>Some great pre-bed reading. They also has a great guide on pitch deck design...just remember that the point of a startup is not to make a pitc deck, it is to solve a problem.</p>
